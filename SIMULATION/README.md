# 🎯 Simulation - System Testing & Validation

Simulation environment for testing and validating the CraneCorp port management system components.

## 🚀 Overview

This directory is reserved for simulation tools, test scenarios, and validation scripts to ensure system reliability before deployment.

## 📋 Planned Components

### System Simulation
- **Hardware Simulation** - Virtual testing of embedded components
- **Network Simulation** - API communication testing
- **Load Testing** - Performance validation under various conditions
- **Integration Testing** - End-to-end system validation

### Test Scenarios
- **Normal Operations** - Standard port management workflows
- **Error Conditions** - System behavior under failure conditions  
- **Performance Limits** - Maximum capacity and throughput testing
- **Security Testing** - Vulnerability assessment and validation

## 🛠️ Future Development

This directory is prepared for future simulation tools and testing frameworks:
